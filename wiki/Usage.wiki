== Gratitude knowledge sharing ==

Rewarding employees of a company, if they share and deposit their knowledge with colleagues within some kind of enterprise platform. 

By providing the information the employee will get paid with reward4j's virtual currency. The commitment can later be gratitude to the employee in a form that is acceptable for the company (monetarily, leisure).

When a employee wants to consume the information that is provided by one of his colleagues, the employee have to pay for it in reward4j's virtual currency. Thus, a employee must share his knowledge or business relevant information in order to have the possibility to use the information of others.

The reward4j approach can be the base for an incentive system that is easy to integrate within existing systems.
